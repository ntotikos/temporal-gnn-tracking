# temporal-gnn-tracking
This repository gives an insight into my research intern at the Chair of Human-Machine Communication at TUM. The project was about multi-camera multi-object tracking (MC-MOT) with a special focus on data association. Data association is the step in which we try to assign a global id to all detected object. The idea to use temporal GNNs for the association task is motivated by the ([DyGLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06856) paper.
